# Code Review Feedback for PR #52 - Log Rotation

## Gemini Review

### CRITICAL Issues:
1. **Race condition and performance bottleneck** (logger.go:98) - Spawning goroutine for every log message causes:
   - Excessive goroutine creation under high load
   - Race condition between log writing and file rotation
   - Potential writes to closed/renamed files

### HIGH Issues:
2. **Brittle backup file matching** (rotation.go:123) - Current logic could accidentally delete unrelated files

### MEDIUM Issues:
3. **Insufficient error logging** (rotation.go:114,158) - Errors during cleanup are silently ignored
4. **Cross-filesystem limitation** (rotation.go:65) - os.Rename fails across different filesystems

## O3-mini Review

### HIGH Issues:
1. **Excessive goroutine creation** (logger.go:96) - Same issue as Gemini identified
2. **Sort order issues** (rotation.go:138) - os.Stat errors cause non-deterministic sorting

### MEDIUM Issues:
3. **Async rotation timing** (logger.go:95) - Potential mismatch between rotation and logging
4. **Timestamp collision** (rotation.go:61) - Second-level precision may cause name collisions

### LOW Issues:
5. **Loose backup matching** (rotation.go:123) - May include unrelated files
6. **Duplicate removal attempts** (rotation.go:147,153) - Two separate cleanup loops

## Common Themes:
- Both reviewers identified the critical goroutine/race condition issue
- Both noted the loose backup file matching pattern
- Performance and correctness under high load are primary concerns
