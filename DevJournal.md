## [2025-01-19] - PR #1: Initial v0.1 Foundation - Hello World

### Actions: 
- Created main.go with simple Hello World implementation
- Initialized Go module with go.mod file
- Created Makefile with build, run, clean, test, and build-all targets
- Attempted to test build locally (Go not installed on development system)

### Decisions:
- Used standard Go project structure with main.go at root
- Set module name as github.com/sqlite-otel/sqlite-otel
- Targeted Go 1.21 for compatibility
- Created comprehensive Makefile with cross-platform build support

### Challenges:
- Go runtime not installed on the development system, preventing local testing
- Build verification will need to be done in environment with Go installed

### Learnings:
- Always verify development environment has required tools before starting
- Makefile provides good abstraction for build commands
- Cross-platform build targets can be pre-configured for future use
