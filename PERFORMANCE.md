# Performance Optimization with Prepared Statements

## Overview

This document outlines the performance optimization strategy using prepared statements.

## Current Issue

Currently, SQL statements are parsed and compiled for every insert operation, which creates significant overhead when processing high volumes of telemetry data.

## Solution: Prepared Statements

Prepared statements compile the SQL once and reuse it multiple times with different parameters.

### Benefits
- Reduces SQL parsing overhead by 90%+
- Improves insert performance significantly
- Reduces CPU usage
- Better for high-throughput scenarios

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Prepare statements at initialization**
   ```go
   spanStmt, err := db.Prepare(`INSERT INTO spans (...) VALUES (...)`)
   ```

2. **Reuse within transactions**
   ```go
   tx.Stmt(spanStmt).Exec(params...)
   ```

3. **Statement lifecycle management**
   - Prepare once at startup
   - Close on shutdown
   - Handle reconnections gracefully

## Expected Performance Improvement

Based on industry benchmarks:
- 3-5x faster for batch inserts
- Reduced latency for individual operations
- Lower database CPU usage
